# Sqlana Store üêò

## Introduction

For ages storing data in accounts was a pain. You had to create a new account type for each new data type you wanted to store, you had to pay for each account and it was expensive(something like 9000 bytes = 0.02 sol/0.6 USD). That's where Store. Store leverages the genesys go's network which is cheap and fast(1GB = 0.8 USD) to create NoSQL Db structure of database, collections and documents. Using this sdk you can easily use shadow drive as a db for your dapp.
